# Software Development Plan - Superhero database

## Purpose and Scope

### Purpose:
The purpose of the superhero database is so that you can store all your superhero knowledge in one spot. An application where you can find, list, create different superhero information. If new information comes out for the superhero you can edit their information. It will list the hero's name, alias, height, superpowers and stats.

### Problem:
It provides users with a quick method to look up superhero information no matter what universe or publishing company they come from. All the information is conveniently in one location. If you are watching a movie or just needing to prove your friends wrong you can look up the database to check your information.   


### Target audience and usage:
The target audience would be anyone keen to keep a database of superheros. Movie buffs, comic buffs or superhero fans so that they could look up information about their superhero quickly. Users will be able to find, update, delete and create superheroes.
